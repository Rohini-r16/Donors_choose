# About Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm used for classification
tasks. Hence, it is also called *Naive Bayes Classifier*. Naive bayes assumes
that features are independent of each other and there is no correlation between
features. However, this is not the case in real life. This naive assumption of
features being uncorrelated is the reason why this algorithm is called *naive*.
The intuition behind na√Øve bayes algorithm is Bayes theorem.

Naive bayes classifier calculates the probabilities of all the classes given a set of
feature values as below:
